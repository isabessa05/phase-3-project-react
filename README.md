# Poemland

Did you ever felt like writing something but didn't even knew how to start? Probably not, but for those who did, we have a solution to your problems!!

Poemland helps you create a poem based on a simple lyric. We give you the inspiration to be creative based on the best pop songs out there (most of them by Taylor Swift).


#Frontend


Our frontend has a navbar that allows your to change to different pages: 
- All poems lets you see all the poems currently on the website 
- Users lets you login (or delete) a user, but please don't delete something that doesn't belong to you! We are working on getting the login/password functionality working. 
  -Still in users, you can click on a user and see all the poems that belong to that user, and also edit or delete does poems.
  -You can also crete a new poem with the create a poem button, which will appear or disappear it's form on click. Everytime you request create a new poem, you will be given new lyrics. Isn't that neat?
 -Add your own lyrics allows you to, well, add new lyrics to our website! You won't be able to pick the lyrics and create the poem out of them, since they are shown randomly, but rest assure, we got your lyrics in our backend now!
 -New user explains how the website works and let's you create your own account to save all your poems in it!
